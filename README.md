# Simple Nextjs Authenticaiton example

> [Implementing Simple Auth To Your Next.js Website using Next.js Auth](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/implementing-simple-auth-to-your-next-js-website-using-next-js-auth-e136d77bb333)

Referencing the example above I updated the version of the Simple username and password authentication.

[NextAuth.js Credentials](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/credentials)

The Offical Credentials page contains the following warning:
> The functionality provided for credentials based authentication is intentionally limited to discourage use of passwords due to the inherent security risks associated with them and the additional complexity associated with supporting usernames and passwords.

## Built with Nextjs

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
